Pomegraph was developed by Naobumi V. Sasaki, National Institute of Infectious Diseases(NIID),
Japan, 2022. Basic concepts and interfaces ware developed as "iGraph.JS" by Christian Tominski *et al*.

## About
**Pomegraph** is a graphical tool for visualization and handling the contact trace diagram especially for SARS-CoV-2 analysis.
This software was developed upon **iGraph.js**, a demo application of interactive graph visualization. The Pomegraph draws mutal linkage  among subjects based on epigenetic and genomic reconessence information , which are represented as labeled nodes which size (more precisely node area) and color are used to visualize the linkage degree of subjects. Besides basic navigation via zoom and pan, Pomgraph implements an interactive radar and interactive graph lenses. The original ideas behind these interaction techniques have been published in:
